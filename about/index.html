			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>
			I'm a Great Lakes native originally from Detroit, MI.  I attended the University of Notre Dame for my undergraduate work,
			and majored in Economics, spending one semester in London.  
			Upon graduating, I moved to Cincinnati, OH to work as a marketing analyst for analytics firm dunnhumbyUSA
			, and began work on a masters degree in Statistics through Texas A&M University.  dunnhumbyUSA was partially
			acquired by the grocery retailer Kroger (5th largest retailer in the United States) to form
			84.51; after the acquisition, I moved into a data scientist role, working with Kroger's ecommerce platform.  
			</p>
			
			<p>
			My non-statistical interests include coffee appreciation, cooking, taking pictures of food in restaurants,
			listening to podcasts about tech, listening to audiobooks about pretty much anything, hiking and trail running,
			American football, supporting the Cincinnati library system, talking to interesting people,
			and visiting places I've never been.
