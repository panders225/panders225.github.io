			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>
			I'm a Great Lakes native originally from Detroit, MI.  I attended the University of Notre Dame for my undergraduate work,
			and majored in Economics, focusing on how economists use data to understand theories about human behavior;
			while at Notre Dame, I spent one semester in London.  
			Upon graduating, I moved to Cincinnati, OH to work for analytics consultancy dunnhumbyUSA as a Marketing Analyst
			, and began work on a masters degree in Statistics, through Texas A&M University.  dunnhumbyUSA was partially
			acquired by Grocery Retailer Kroger (5th largest retailer in the United States) in 2015 to form
			84.51; I have since moved into a data scientist role, working with Kroger's ecommerce platform.  
			</p>
			
			<p>
			My non-statistical interests include coffee appreciation, cooking, taking pictures of food in restaurants,
			listening to podcasts about tech, listening to audiobooks about pretty much anything, hiking and trail running,
			American football, supporting the Cincinnati library system, talking to interesting people,
			and visiting places I've never been.
