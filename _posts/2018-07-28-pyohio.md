## Foreward
_So, you’ve decided you’re doing it._
In late 2014 I decided to go for it and applied to Texas A&M’s Masters of Statistics program, which not only appeared to be very well-regarded, but also had the option of 100% online completion. I would be able to continue my work of designing and evaluating real-world advertising campaigns, while earning the degree that I had decided I needed. Easy, right? Wrong. While it has brought me a great many benefits, earning this degree has easily been the most challenging endeavor I have ever undertaken. Four years (!) later, however, I am in my final semester, and consider myself to be a work + school veteran. Reflecting on that journey, I realized that there were a multitude of things I wish I had known prior to starting, if for no other reason than that I would have had a better idea of what I was getting myself into. This guide is the brief manual that I wish that I had had access to 4 years ago — if you are considering the pursuit of a graduate degree while working, or are already doing so, this is for you, and I hope you find it useful.
